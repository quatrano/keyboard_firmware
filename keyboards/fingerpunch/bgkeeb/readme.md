## Choosing which board to plug the USB cable into (choosing Master)

Because the two boards are identical, the firmware has logic to differentiate the left and right board. It uses two strategies to figure things out, [EE_HANDS](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_split_keyboard?id=handedness-by-eeprom) or [by define](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_split_keyboard?id=handedness-by-define). See [setting-handedness](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/config_options?id=setting-handedness) for more information.
